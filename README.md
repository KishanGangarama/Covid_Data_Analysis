# Data Analyst Portfolio Project | SQL Data Exploration | Project 1/4
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Data Analyst Portfolio Project focused on SQL data exploration. The project aims to provide beginners with a practical understanding of SQL, data cleaning, and visualization using Python and Tableau.

## Introduction
In this project, we will explore a dataset related to COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations. The primary goal is to perform data exploration and gain insights from the dataset. We will also cover data cleaning techniques using SQL and visualize the results using Python and Tableau.

## Getting the Dataset
To begin, we need to download the dataset, which contains information on total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, total vaccinations, people vaccinated, and population data. We will reformat the dataset, create a new table called "covid_deaths," and import the death information into it.

## Importing Datasets into SQL
Make sure you have set up a database and import the two Excel files provided in the project. The process of importing the data can be done manually through the Excel workbook or using SQL server management tools. Ensure that the server names and configurations are correctly set up to avoid any import issues.

## Data Exploration
Once the datasets are imported, we will begin the data exploration phase. We will query the tables and select relevant data for analysis. Throughout the exploration, we will perform various calculations, such as calculating the percentage of people who died from the reported cases. We will examine the total cases, population, and vaccination rates to gain insights into the COVID-19 situation.

## Visualization
After extracting insights from the data, we will use Python and Tableau to create visualizations. The visualizations will help present the findings in a more intuitive and understandable manner. We will explore different visualization techniques to showcase the data effectively.

## Usage
To run the code and replicate the project, follow these steps:

Set up a SQL database and import the provided Excel files.
Execute the SQL queries provided in the project to perform data exploration and cleaning.
Use Python to perform further analysis and calculations on the extracted data.
Utilize Tableau or other visualization tools to create meaningful visual representations of the data.
Save the code, visualizations, and project documentation in a GitHub repository.

## Additional Notes
Feel free to customize and expand upon the project. Explore your own queries and insights to make the portfolio project unique.
The project's primary focus is on SQL data exploration, but it also incorporates Python and Tableau for data analysis and visualization.
Make sure to appropriately document your code and provide explanations for the insights gained from the data.
Consider creating views or temporary tables to facilitate data analysis and reuse of code snippets.
Remember to include a Readme file in your GitHub repository summarizing the project's purpose, steps, and findings.
