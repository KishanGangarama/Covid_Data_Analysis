# Data Analyst Portfolio Project | SQL Data Exploration | Project 1/4
This repository contains the code and documentation for the Data Analyst Portfolio Project focused on SQL data exploration. The project aims to provide beginners with a practical understanding of SQL, data cleaning, and visualization using Python and Tableau.

## Introduction
In this project, we will explore a dataset related to COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations. The primary goal is to perform data exploration and gain insights from the dataset. We will also cover data cleaning techniques using SQL and visualize the results using Python and Tableau.

## Getting the Dataset
To begin, we need to download the dataset, which contains information on total cases, new cases, total deaths, new deaths, total vaccinations, people vaccinated, and population data. We will reformat the dataset, create a new table called "covidDeaths" and "CovidVaccination" to import the death and vaccination information into it.

## Importing Datasets into SQL
We should make sure to set up a database and import the two Excel files provided in the project. The process of importing the data can be done manually through the Excel workbook or using SQL server management tools.

## Data Exploration
Once the datasets are imported, we will begin the data exploration phase. We will query the tables and select relevant data for analysis. Throughout the exploration, we will perform various calculations, such as calculating the percentage of people who died from the reported cases. We will examine the total cases, population, and vaccination rates to gain insights into the COVID-19 situation.

## Visualization
After extracting insights from the data, we will use Tableau to create visualizations. The visualizations will help present the findings in a more intuitive and understandable manner. We will explore different visualization techniques to showcase the data effectively.
